Uses code from https://github.com/fjxmlzn/DoppelGANger, which was cloned into this sub-directory. DoppelGANger code was omitted in this repository to prevent plagiarism and licensing issues. If one aims to run DoppelGANger, clone the repository contents from the author's repository into the sub-directory. *training.py* and *generating.ipynb* includes code for training DoppelGANger and subsequently generating synthetic data for our use case. *DoppelGANgerTransformer.ipynb* contains code used for transforming data to DoppelGANger input format (before training) and reverse transforming the synthetic data generated by DoppelGANger to the original data format (after generation). */test* is where the checkpoints for training DoppelGANger were stored and */generated_data* is where the data generated by DoppelGANger (in DoppelGANger format) is stored, which is omitted due to confidentiality.
